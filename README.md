# Broughlike Template

This is a simple template for making a rougelike game in the style of Michael Brough.

This template was used to create:
- [Escorial](https://zunil.itch.io/escorial)
- [Mosaic](https://zunil.itch.io/mosaic)

It uses PixiJS, Typescript and Webpack.

## Quick-start guide

Once you have cloned the repository, you need to install all the required node packages:

    npm install

Then, you have to pack the sprites into a spritesheet:

    npm run pack-sprites

To run the project with a watcher (dev mode) that will automatically refresh and compile whenever you make a change:

    npm run start

To produce a build:

    npm run build

## Other resources

Jeremiah Reid has an excellent tutorial (https://nluqo.github.io/broughlike-tutorial/) focussed on making a Broughlike in JavaScript. It starts from the basics, so that's recommended if you want to develop your engine from scratch.
